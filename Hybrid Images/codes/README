Instructions for execution of the scripts:
1. MATLAB 2012b version for Ubuntu used to create these MATLAB scripts.
2. The directory ("2012CSB1039" folder) where all the source code files are kept should be “Added to the path” in MATLAB.
3. Run the "Testscript.m" file in Matlab Console to get the output images of all the functions.

Other Information
______________________
The kernel size used for convolving the images with the gaussian filters is 50.
I have used the following Sigma Values (by passing the corresponding frequencies) for creating the Hybrid Images

Given Images:
Cat	50 			Dog 5
Marilyn 50		Einstein 3
Fish 50			Submarine 6
Bicycle 20		Motorcycle 3
Bird 40			Plane 10


Sample Images from the internet:
Girl 2.5		Woman 4.5
Umbrella 3		Watermellon 6


Note :
Due to large size of the kernel that is used, the script takes a few minutes to execute
